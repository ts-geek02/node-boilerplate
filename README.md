## Pull Request Validation

This project includes automated PR description validation to ensure all pull requests follow a consistent template structure.

### PR Template

All pull requests must include the following sections:

- **General Description** - Summary of changes and purpose
- **What type of PR is this?** - Checkboxes for Bugfix, Feature, Enhancement, etc.
- **Related Tickets & Documents** - Links to related issues
- **QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings** - Testing instructions
- **Did you create or update documentation in the README?** - Documentation updates
- **Environment Variables Updated?** - Environment changes
- **Added/updated tests?** - Test coverage
- **Did you test this feature in all browsers?** - Browser testing
- **Are there any post-deployment tasks we need to perform?** - Deployment tasks
- **Did you read the Code Style and does your PR comply with that?** - Code style compliance

### Validation

The validation automatically extracts all `###` headers from the PR template and checks if they're present in the PR description. It runs on:

- **GitHub Actions**: Every PR creation/update via `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`
- **Local Development**: Use `npm run validate-pr "<PR_DESCRIPTION>"` to test locally

**Blocking Behavior:**

- ‚ùå **Failed validation**: Blocks merge button, adds failure comment with missing sections
- ‚úÖ **Passed validation**: Allows merge, adds success comment
- üìù **Automatic comments**: Detailed feedback on what's missing or confirmation of success

### Setup

1. **Branch Protection**: Configure branch protection rules to require the "PR Description Validation" status check
2. **Template**: The PR template is automatically loaded from `.github/pull_request_template.md`
3. **Local Testing**: Test your PR description locally before creating the PR
