# Branch Protection Configuration
# This file documents the recommended branch protection settings
# You can apply these settings in GitHub repository settings

# Recommended Branch Protection Rules:
#
# 1. Require status checks to pass before merging:
#    - "PR Description Validation" (from .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml) - REQUIRED
#    - "Lint" (if you have a lint workflow)
#    - "Build" (if you have a build workflow)
#
# 2. Require branches to be up to date before merging
#
# 3. Require pull request reviews before merging
#    - Require at least 1 approving review
#    - Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
#
# 4. Restrict pushes that create files that match the specified glob pattern
#    - **/*.md (to prevent direct edits to documentation)
#
# 5. Allow force pushes (optional, depends on your workflow)
#
# 6. Allow deletions (optional, depends on your workflow)

# To apply these settings:
# 1. Go to your repository Settings > Branches
# 2. Add rule for main/master branch
# 3. Enable the options above
# 4. Save changes

# Example GitHub CLI command to apply branch protection:
# gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
#   --method PUT \
#   --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["PR Description Validation"]}' \
#   --field enforce_admins=true \
#   --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true}' \
#   --field restrictions=null
